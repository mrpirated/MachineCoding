Avishkar, the most awaited event of the year, is here. But it takes a lot of effort and time (and of course, money!) to bring all pieces together.

To conduct the event smoothly, Professors want an expense tracker from Saurabh and Deepesh to track expenses of Avishkar. As both are also DC, so they are busy with some other work. So Can you help both by completing the application?

Avishkar has various departments Cybequest, Electromania, PowerSurge, Rasayans, Genesis, Nirmaan, Mechrocosm, Monopoly, Kreedomania, and Oligopoly.

The application has two types of Users. The first one is Festival Secretary (FS) and the Second one is the Department Coordinator (DC).

Each DC belongs to a department.
FS expense or sponsor Money will not be considered in the department expense or sponsor money.
